// JavaScript Comparison Operators
// Comparison operators compare two values and give back a boolean value: either true or false. 
// Comparison operators are used in decision making and loops.

// Operator	Description	Example
// ==	Equal to: true if the operands are equal	5==5; //true
// equal to operator

// const a = 5, b= 10, c = 'Hello';
// console.log(a == '3'); // true both values should be equals

// !=	Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal 5!=5; //false
// const a = 3, b = 'hello';
// console.log(a != 3); //true

// ===	Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type	5==='5'; //false
const a = 3, b = 'hello';
console.log(a === '1');


// !==	Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all	5!=='5'; //true
// >	Greater than: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand	3>2; //true
// >=	Greater than or equal to: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand	3>=3; //true
// <	Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	3<2; //false
// <=	Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand
