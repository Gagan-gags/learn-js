// JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
// This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.
// JavaScript modules rely on the import and export statements.

// Export

// You can export a function or variable from any file.
// Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.
// There are two types of exports: Named and Default.

// Import
// You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.
// Named exports are constructed using curly braces. Default exports are not.
